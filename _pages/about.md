I am currently pursuing a master's in Biological Data Science, with a background in molecular biology and a passion for turning complex biological questions into data-driven insights. I started my academic journey with a 5-year integrated master’s in Biology, where I gained a strong foundation in cellular and molecular biology. My experience in wet-lab research inspired me to explore computational approaches to biological discovery.

## Why Bioinformatics?

During my research experience in molecular biology, I was drawn to the potential of bioinformatics and data science in understanding biological systems at scale. The ability to analyze large-scale omics datasets, build predictive models, and develop data-driven hypotheses has since become the focus of my work.

## Research Interests

- **Single-cell transcriptomics** – analyzing cell-to-cell variation and mitochondrial function
- **Machine learning in biology** – classification, clustering, and deep learning applications
- **Multi-omics integration** – combining transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics
- **Subcellular localization** – predicting and visualizing protein distributions

## Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, R, Bash
- **Libraries/Packages**: Seurat, Monocle3, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Tools**: Google Colab, Chimera, VMD, Pymol, Gromacs, GitHub, Excel, ImageJ
- **Techniques**: Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, clustering, dimensionality reduction

## Outside the Lab

I enjoy learning guitar, staying active with fitness routines, and exploring creative ways to communicate science. I’m currently working on building a portfolio of bioinformatics projects and showcasing them through this website.
